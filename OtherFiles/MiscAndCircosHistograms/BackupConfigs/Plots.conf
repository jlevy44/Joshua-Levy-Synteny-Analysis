# Like for links, rules are used to dynamically alter formatting of

# block from a file, which contains the following
#
# <rule>
# condition = on(hs1)
# show      = no
# </rule>
#
# to avoid displaying any data on hs1. The rule is included from a
# file because it is reused again in the track below.
