# Joshua-Levy-Synteny-Analysis
###Integrated Analysis of Synteny (Multiple Synteny Comparison for Multiple Alignment, Circos Outputs, Allmaps Genome Reconstructions), Find Ghost Genes, Identify and Analyze CNS Elements from Multiple Alignment Files and More!


##Using Integrated Analysis:
1. 


Note: Delete Sort Files after every analysis

###Using SyntenyFinal.py and Circos.py:
1. See their relevant readmes

###Using AllMAPS: (Must run on linux or linux server, for now)
Recommend: Run through the integrated analysis by setting performALLMAPS = 1
1. 


###Using ALLMAPS_alternate: (Must run on linux or linux server, for now)
Recommend: Run through the integrated analysis by setting performALLMAPSAlt = 1, must set performALLMAPS = 0
1. 

##Using findGhostSegments:
1. 



##Using CNS Analysis (workwithMAF and manipulateFilesTest):
1. 
  
  
  
###What to do after CNS Analysis Completes:
1. Convert fasta files to phylip files and run them under PhyML to generate trees. Can visualize these trees using FigTree.
2. If using NERSC, module load PhyML. ^^^
